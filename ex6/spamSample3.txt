A home warranty is a renewable service contract that covers the repair or replacement of many of the most frequently occurring breakdowns of system components and appliances. 
Your home is most likely one of your biggest investments. Unexpected repair or replacement costs of covered items can easily strain your budget. Plus, finding a qualified professional to solve your problems can be stressful and inconvenient.
